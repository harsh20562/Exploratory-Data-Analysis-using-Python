# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-Python
I did exploratory data analysis using my knowledge of pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn libraries of Python. I analysed Crime against Women from 2001-2014. I tried my best to express the data in more organised way. This project gave me a good grasp on these libraries of Python. It was a great learning for me.
